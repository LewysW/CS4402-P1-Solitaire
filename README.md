# CS4402-P1-Solitaire
First practical for constraint programming module. Models and solves a particular variant of solitaire.

To run the essence prime model using this script, perform the following steps:

1.  Open a terminal window in the ’CS4402-P1-Solitaire/src/’ directory

2.  Run the following comand:

    ./run.sh <parameter file name>

For example:

    ./run.sh LBS9_0.param

The Savile Row directory has been omitted from this submission for obvious reasons.If the reader should desire to run any examples using the implemented Essence Primemodel, they should include the Savile Row directory in the ’CS4402-P1-Solitaire/’ direc-tory.
